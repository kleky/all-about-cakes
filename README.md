## Quick Start & Documentation

#### Running the app

`npm run start:api` then in parallel: 

`npm run start:app` for the web app 
...or... `npm run start:pwa-app` for the PWA

### Tests

`npm run test`


`npm run e2e`


This uses the monorepo as provided by nx.dev. You get a lot 
right out of the box with their cli working with 
(and on top on) Angular cli.

Sadly this framework was a first for me, so it left me with
 insufficient time to do everything I would have liked, notably:
- Cypress UI e2e tests
- Form and DB entity validation
- Security
- Full test coverage
